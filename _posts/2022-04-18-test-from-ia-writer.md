# Test from iA writer

So let's see if this app is something to use when creating this posts.

I've added the posts-folder to iA writer to see all the .md posts. When I'm done, GitHub desktop app should see that there is a new file. Then I commit this page to the repository and all should be good. I hope.

Let's try to add a picture and size it.
